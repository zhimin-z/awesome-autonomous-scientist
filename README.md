# Awesome Autonomous Researcher Frameworks [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of autonomous researcher frameworks that can independently conduct research, design experiments, analyze data, write papers, and generate scientific discoveries.

[Autonomous researchers](https://edisonscientific.com/articles/announcing-kosmos) represent a new paradigm in scientific discovery where AI systems can perform the complete research lifecycle - from hypothesis generation to peer review - with minimal or no human intervention. These systems leverage large language models and multi-agent frameworks to accelerate scientific progress across multiple domains.

## Open Source Frameworks

- [AI-Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.svg) - First comprehensive system for fully automatic scientific discovery. Enables LLMs to autonomously generate research ideas, conduct experiments, and write academic papers across multiple domains.
- [agentic-data-scientist](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/agentic-data-scientist) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/K-Dense-AI/agentic-data-scientist.svg) - Multi-agent framework for data science workflows built on Google's Agent Development Kit and Claude Agent SDK. Separates planning from execution with continuous validation and adaptive approach.
- [Researcher](https://github.com/zhu-minjun/Researcher) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhu-minjun/Researcher.svg) - AI-powered research assistant for automated research workflows.
