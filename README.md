# Awesome Autonomous Researcher Frameworks [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of autonomous researcher frameworks that can independently conduct research, design experiments, analyze data, write papers, and generate scientific discoveries.

[Autonomous researchers](https://edisonscientific.com/articles/announcing-kosmos) represent a new paradigm in scientific discovery where AI systems can perform the complete research lifecycle - from hypothesis generation to peer review - with minimal or no human intervention. These systems leverage large language models and multi-agent frameworks to accelerate scientific progress across multiple domains.

## Open-source Tools

- [AI-Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.svg) - First comprehensive system for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling LLMs to autonomously generate ideas, run experiments, and write papers.
